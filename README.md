# RemoveDuplicateFiles
 Remove Duplicated files.

## How it works?
 the program takes the file path from user, then calculates its sha-256 hash, then takes the folder to search in from user and start search for files with the same sha-256.

## Installation:
1. install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. create a new .py file and copy the source code into it.
1. run script.

*NOTE: 'the folder path not included sub-folders'.

if you want to contribute, fork it.
